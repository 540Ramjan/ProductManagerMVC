# MVCRomjanProject
Description:
In this MVC (Model-View-Controller) project, the goal is to create a web application that allows users to perform CRUD operations on products. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations needed for managing data in a database.

Components:

Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It defines how the product data will be structured and managed. This includes database interactions, validation rules, and any other business logic related to products.

View: The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user and receiving user input. In this project, the views would include interfaces for listing products, displaying details of a specific product, and forms for adding/editing products.

Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user input, processes requests, interacts with the Model to fetch or manipulate data, and then passes the appropriate data to the View for rendering.

Functionality:

Create: Users can add new products to the database by filling out a form with product details such as name, description, price, and any other relevant information.

Read: Users can view a list of all products, along with summary information. They can also click on a product to view its detailed information on a separate page.

Update: Users can edit the details of existing products. This involves retrieving the product's information, allowing the user to make changes, and then updating the database with the modified data.

Delete: Users can delete products from the database. This action would prompt a confirmation and, upon confirmation, remove the selected product's data from the database.
